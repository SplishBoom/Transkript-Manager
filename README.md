# transkript-manager

First of all, this is a kind of management system which only works with the format of MEF University !

* The purpose of this project is to answer questionn of "How would my CPGA will be if I have taken A for a B+ course for example.
* The system is not providing this much info on itself. It only provides the current semester for calculations. 
* However, you can check all of your academical history by this system. (You are welcome)


# 1-) Important for automatic logings, you can create a json file -> "Sources/payload.json". 
    * After that you can fill the file by the format below.
    * {
    *     "username" : "someUserName",
    *     "password" : "somePassWord",
    *     "autoLogin" : true
    * }

    * Note that, you should type right username and password, otherwise it will not login automatically.

# 2-) You can directly use requirements.txt to set up your environment.
